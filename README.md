### My Data Science Journey

Welcome to my git repository where you can find all my journey in Data Science.

I will follow some free courses in Data Science through Coursera, Kaggle or Books available on Internet.

I will also bought on course on Udemy that I found interesting to begin, and that was around 10 euros, very affordable.

You will also see me go through some books that you have to pay.

First, I will start with the Statistical Inference Course available for free on Coursera :

You can find my notes in the following path : https://github.com/Thrynk/My-Data-Science-Journey/tree/master/Coursera/Johns%20Hopkins%20University/Statistical%20Inference

I will update this file to add following steps of my adventure.

Hope this will help you if you need some ideas to begin Data Science.
