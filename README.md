### My Data Science Journey

In this git, I will start to learn Data Science. I will go through some free courses available on Coursera, Udemy (those aren't free) or Kaggle.

I will also read some famous books on the topic.

First things first, I will dive into the Statistical Inference Course on Coursera : https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference/

We started with this very important notion for Data Science in my school, so I wanted to learn a little bit more on this topic before going through Python or R librairies.

Hope this will help you if you need some ideas to begin Data Science.
